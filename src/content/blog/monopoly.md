Ive just recently played monopoly for the first time with my roommates. I feel like there's gems of knowledge within the game that coincide with real life. The game is largely based on luck and random dice rolls. But I realised that we can't control our luck when it's bad, what we can control is what happens when luck finally goes in our favour. You can't control if you have a bad roll of dice and land on a hotel and lose a shitton of money. But you can control to decide if you wanna hedge your bets, take a chance and build a lot of houses or a hotel on your own property such that when luck does work for you, and someone does land on your property, then shit does turn out to be okay. High risk high reward I guess. And maybe this is a reflection of reality that we need to take risks, we need to play the so called game of life so that when luck does play out in our favour, we know what to do with it. We can choose to maximise the rewards we reap by carefully choosing where we sow our seed.
